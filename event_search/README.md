# Event Search

Event Search is a Flutter-based application designed to showcase a list of events based on search kezwords. This project serves as a test application to prepare for technical interviews, demonstrating skills in Flutter development, state management, and API integration.

## Features

- Fetch and display a list of events from a remote API.
- Detailed event information, including images and descriptions.
- Responsive design for both Android and iOS platforms.
- Utilizes modern Flutter libraries like `bloc`, `freezed`, `get_it`, `injectable` and `retrofit`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Android Studio or Xcode for platform-specific builds.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keresztesitekla/event_search.git
   cd event_search/event_search
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
    flutter pub get
```
    
In order to get events from Ticketmaster you need to create a free account and pass your api key as an environment variable with the `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY` name. Please be careful and don't commit your api keys to any repos.

3. Regenerate files:
```bash
    dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
Generated files are pushed to the repo, so there's no need to generate them before running the app. Generation needs to be done only when there are changes.

4. Run the app:
```bash
    flutter run
```
Please note that the .vscode/launch.json file is added to the ignored files list.
